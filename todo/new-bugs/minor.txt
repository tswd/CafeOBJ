I would like to give some comments on your libary.
I needed some modification to run them on the current interpreter,
all of them are very minor ones.

(1) context of reduce/open commands.
    There are many codes assuming this switch is on as default. 
    Please take care about this, i.e., putting the line `set auto
    context on' at the head of each example, or specifying the 
    context explictly for each reduce/open command. 

(2) other minor modifications.
    i) nnat-hsa.mod
       because the (syntactical) associativity of operator _|_
       is not specified, terms of form `A | B | C' causes 
       warning. explicit parenthesizing for terms or specifying
       a attribute like r-assoc is needed.
    ii) path.mod
       now the intereter handles sort membership predicate, 
       this example works. but there is a typo in code:
       the exiom 
         ceq (E ; ?P) : Path  = if (?P : Path) and (s ?P) == (t E) .
       should be 
         ceq (E ; ?P) : Path  = true if (?P : Path) and (s ?P) == (t E) .
