I think this is a good idea, but there is a big problem. 
I have already considered this issue when I tried the first implementation
of sort membership. However I did not finish this, because it requires
too much changes. Let me describe why in brief. 
The problem is the ambiguities of sort of terms. 
Assume that user declares some axioms of `_: S', if we consider `_: S'
for determining the sort of a term, the process is not deterministic 
in general. A simple term can have diffrent sorts which  are in a 
connected component but has no partial order relation with each other.
To solve this problem, we cannot assign single sort to a term, 
instead we must assing a set of possible sort. Also, matching
should be performed in `membership' not in `order sorted'.
