Dear Toshimi,

 |I can try an experimental implementation, but before starting,
 |I want some more discussion about this issue.

I agree that this needs more very serious thinking before starting to
do something. My proposal is for a status-quo until we come up with a
clear design idea which will be perfectly consistent. The actual
approach is at least perfectly consistent with the semantics of the
language, so we should be very careful if we replace/extend it.

Personally, I become more and more accomodated with the current
approach. After all, if the specifier is careful for readability he
might introduce some comments reminding all current parameters of a
module.

Actually, do you think the describe command can be enhaced such that
it will draw the cooresponding diagram of parameters and imports. I
mean things like

TRIV ---X---> A >------> B
              ^          ^
              |          |
              |          | 
              Y          X
              |          |
              |          |
            STRING      MON

and such kind of things. Maybe a separate command might be even a
better idea. Or maybe Forsdonnet should do this? In my opinion such
diagrams for the module system would be a tool of enormous help for
system development.
