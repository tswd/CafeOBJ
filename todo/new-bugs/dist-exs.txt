Dear Toshimi,

 |Would you please prepare a page of examples at somewhere reachable
 |from CafeOBJ home page of JAIST so that people can easily get trusted 
 |good examples? 
 |Every time I release a new version, I will include the up to date
 |version of examples kept in the page. 

Yes, in fact I am doing this right now, exactly how you describe. I am
working now full time to update and polish my library. Then we will
put these on our web site (which is under re-construction right now by
Iida-san and me) and also send them to you in order put them in the
distribution. I suggest that any of us may add examples afterwards,
but it would be a good idea to submit it to the rest of us for some
checking (I will happily do this). I one week time I hope to finish
this and have a good collection of examples to be included in the
distribution.

 |Preferably, these examples should work in the implementation, but
 |it is not neccessally. It can act as showing `should be' of the 
 |current implementation also.

I fully agree with this.

All the best!
Razvan
