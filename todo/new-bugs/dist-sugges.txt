Subject:  CafeOBJ distribution examples 
Content-Type: text
Content-Length: 496

I have some rather serious suggestion (maybe mentioned before).
I think we should delete the examples from the actual distribution due
to the following reasons:

1. Some of them are obsolete and containing serious mistakes
2. They also provide a rather misleading image about the actual
CafeOBJ
3. People have now many other sources of examples which are very
carefully done (such as the ATM). 

But of course, the most serious issue is that of mistaken or awkward
specs.

All the best!
Razvan
