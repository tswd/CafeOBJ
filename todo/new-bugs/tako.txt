Moreover, there is no way to use the above notation to:

	mod M {
	pr (LIST + SET)
	...
	}

if both of the parameters (morhisums) of LIST and SET are named X.
You should do something like:

	mod M {
	pr (LIST + SET(Y))
	...
	}

and in this case this would be more natural and readable to write:

	mod M (X :: TRIV, Y :: TRIV) {
	pr (LIST(X) + SET(Y))
	...
	}

This is what I mean by the notational problem.
