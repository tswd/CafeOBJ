Dear Nakagawa-san,

I am reading your fascinating theory of groups example (passed to me
by Sawada-san). I enjoy this very much, and I want to study it
carefully. Therefore I will send you some comments, some of them very
scattered. Since I send/receive email only each two days, you will
receive messages written at various stages of my reading at once. I
apologize for this.

For the moment I have two small comments:

1. I think the import SUBGROUP -> NORMAL is protecting:

module* NORMAL {
  protecting (SUBGROUP * { sort H -> N })

As far as I see correctly, accordingly to the current CafeOBJ
semantics, the denotation of NORMAL is exactly the set of pairs formed
by a  group with a normal subgroup.

2. It seems to me it would be more natural to make more use of
parameters. For example,

module* SUBGROUP (G :: GROUP) {
  [ H < G ]
  vars U V : G
  eq [sub-0]: 0 :is H = true .
  ceq [sub-+]: U + V :is H = true if (U :is H) and (V :is H) .
  ceq [sub--]: - U :is H = true if U :is H .
}

For things like G-HOM and other such things it seems parameterization
is really nice.

Once I get b2 compiled by Iida-san I will try to do some modifications
for myself and see how it goes. Also, if you do some updating I will
be glad to have all the time the latest version.

Best regards,
Razvan
