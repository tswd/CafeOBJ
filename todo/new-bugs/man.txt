 |I fully agree, and sorry about that. I personaly want to rearrange the
 |organization of the manual and of course make it be up to date.
 |I've just started a personal work in which I will investigage very 
 |carefully the current implementation with respect to CafeOBJ report
 |and examples in the jewels. After this work, I will discuss about 
 |the new release of our manual with Nakagawa.

Thanks, I will be happy to assist with this too. I also have some
ideas about the CafeOBJ manual, the most important is that it should
really be browsable (like an online manual in the style of emacs info
or some html structure, or maybe both if possible). It should also be
very dry stuff (online manuals are very dry), so very different from a
book style.

With respect to the current implementation we can continue investigate
it along other examples I have, and we can extend these examples even
further in order to understand more about the current implementation.

Best regards,
Razvan
