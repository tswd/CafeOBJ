I put a new interpter (version 1.4.1(p7)) on 
	ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/lang/CafeOBJ/cafeobj-1.4.1p7.tar.gz

This includes fixes as listed below:
1. type mismatch is now detected at parse time for universally 
   defined built-in operatos, such as _==_, if_then_else_fi, etc.
   (this was reported by s_iida@jaist.ac.jp)
2. context udating just after open a module is properly done.
   (this was reported by Razvan as a `little bug on =*= ??',)
3. a bug in ac matching newly introduced in 1.4.1p5, which 
   incorrectly matches `a * a * b' to `a * b * b'. 
   (this was reported by ishisone@sra.co.jp).
4. sort assignment problem of ad-hoc overloading operators.
   (reported by s_iida@jaist.ac.jp, this was already fixed in p6 but 
    which has not been released).

Very thanks to all who reported problems. I know that there
remains problems which some of you think them as bugs, such as 
the issue of carrying formal parameters among modules, but I think
we need some further discussion on these problems.
