Dear Razvan,

The system already warned you :-)

  [Warning]: non-behavioural operation on hidden sorts appering in the behavioural axiom:
           take put(E,B) = put(E,take B) if not empty?(B).

Well, the system does some optimization (you may say it's incorrect)
for checking beh context, it assumes that any beh axiom constructs 
a proper beh cotext. This is needed for efficient beh context check.
This is the reason why former interpreter pretened beh axioms containing
non behavioural operators from using it as a rewrite rule.
The current interpreter allows such axioms to be rewrite rules.
This is the reason why you got the problematic result.
