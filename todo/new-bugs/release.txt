Dear Razvan,

I will delete current examples from the distribution from the 
next release (sorry, p7 still includes them.)

Would you please prepare a page of examples at somewhere reachable
from CafeOBJ home page of JAIST so that people can easily get trusted 
good examples? 
Every time I release a new version, I will include the up to date
version of examples kept in the page. 

Preferably, these examples should work in the implementation, but
it is not neccessally. It can act as showing `should be' of the 
current implementation also.

Best wishes
