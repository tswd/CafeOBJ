Dear Razvan,

Thanks for your report. First, I would like to show you a proof
score which is properly performed in the current system. Then I
will describe problems with the current implementation.

  open G-HOM
  start 0 h == 0 .
  apply -G'.r-id at (1) . -- was apply -GROUP.r-id at (1) .
  apply -G'.r-inv with X = (0 h) at (1 2) .
                          -- was apply -GROUP.r-inv with X = (0 h) at (1 2) .
  apply -.hom at [1 .. 2] of (1) .
  apply reduce at term .
  close

I changed rule specs in first two apply commands as 
	-GROUP.r-id	--> -G'.r-id
        -GOURP.r-inv	--> -G'.r-inv
This is because
(1) The current implementation does not allow (fail) the direct
    reference of axioms declared in imported modules which are
    applied some operation on them, i.e., renaming, instantiation.
    You might understand difficulties for these cases. For example,
    consider a case of instantiation of the parameterized module M. 
    If a supplied view maps an operator Op to Op', we cannot use an
    axiom of M containing Op directly. We must change the axiom 
    according to the map given by the view.
