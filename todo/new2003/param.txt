-- inheritance of pricipal sort: (May 24th or 25th):
I little bit changed my mind, and did an experiment with the
inheritance of principal sort.

Please try the patch enclosed in this mail, and please examine the 
behaviour of the system. If there are no problems, I will include 
this in the next release.

If you applied this patch, principal sort is inherited in the 
following cases:
(1) if a parameterized module M has a principal sort PS,
    its instatiation has principal sort PS', where PS' is the
    same as PS if it is not mapped.
(2) if a module M has principal sort PS, its renamed module has
    principal sort PS' (may be mapped to another sort).

I generally dislike making exceptional cases, but aboves seems
to be natural. 
Here are some examples using your I-POSET and its friends.
First, this is the result of evaluating STRG-MAPPING declaration,
note there is no explict map from Elt to 2Tuple.
