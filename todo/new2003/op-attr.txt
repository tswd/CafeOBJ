`coherency':

`coherent' attribute is not allowed to be declared 
 to an operator which is imported from other modules.

   comment: i don't know what the semantics will be, i.e.,
            how can we treat imported axioms having an operator
            which was declared as non coherent in the importing module.
            is the module `protected'?
