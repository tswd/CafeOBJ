Syntactical issues:

1. a period(.) is (exceptionaly) required at the end of each declaration
   in `open' environment, i.e., when a module is opened.

   this makes a 

2. membership predicate (differences w.r.t CafeOBJ Report.)

   sorry, but now the implementation is stick to the current syntax (_:is_).
   at least, using _:_ for this predicate will never be adopted.
