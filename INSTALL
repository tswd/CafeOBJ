	    ---------------------------------------------
	    CafeOBJ Interpreter Installation Instructions
	           version 1.4 (with/without PigNose).
	    ---------------------------------------------

============
Prerequisite
============
   CafeOBJ interpreter is built on Common Lisp, thus you need
some Common Lisp system to install CafeOBJ. CafeOBJ can be 
built on the following platforms:
  *(1) GCL(GNU Common Lisp) version 2.2 (or later)
  (2) CMU-CL version 1.8f (or later)
  (3) Allegro CL version 5.0 or later
  (4) CLISP (visit ftp://ftp2.cons.org/pub/lisp/clisp, and
             get the recent one).

Please see README for availability of these platforms.
At least one of these needs to be installed in the users's PATH.

NOTE* it seems that GCL does no run on current Linux.

=================
About `configure'
=================
 The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' of the package. Finally, it
creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run in the future
to recreate the current configuration, a file `config.cache' that
saves the result of its tests to speed up reconfiguring, and file
`config.log' contains compiler output(useful mainly for debugging
configure').

 If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diff or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release. If at some point `config.cache'
contains result you do'nt want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

 The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'. You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

*** Note: don't install CafeOBJ 1.3.0 on top of 1.3.beta,or any other
older versions.  Use a fresh, new, clean directory.
If you ignore this advice, subtle bugs can arise!

============
INSTALLATION
============

First of all, change to the directory in which the cafeobj resources
are put.  We shall call the directory as $src-dir.

1) Run "configure":

	$ cd $src-dir
	$ ./configure -with-lisp="platform"

"platform" specifies the Common Lisp plat form you use, and this
should be one of the followings:
	cmu-pc
	cmu-sparc
	acl
	acl6
        clisp
	gcl
-with-lisp="platform" can be ommited, in this case it defaulted
to `gcl'.

`cmu-pc' is for CMU-CL running on PCs, i.e., Intel x386 or Pentium 
processor family. `cmu-sparc' is for CMU-CL running on Sun sparc
architecture. `acl' is for Allegro Common Lisp, and gcl is
for GNU Common Lisp. With being supplied a "platform", system 
tries to find the path to the corresponding command. For this,
the following command names are assumed for each platform:
	(1) CMU-CL : a command `lisp'
 	(2) GCL : a command `gcl'
	(3) ACL : a command `cl'
        (4) CLISP : a command `clisp'

You must have one of these command in your PATH environment.

*NOTE for ACL users*
---------------------
	With standard installation of ACL version 5.0, the command
	name of the lisp interpter will be set to `lisp', not `cl'.
	So, you need to make the command `cl' be available by some
	means such as making symbolic link from `lisp' to `cl'.
	You can do this as like
		$ cd /usr/local/acl5
		$ ln -s lisp cl
		$ ln -s lisp.dxl cl.dxl
		$ cd /usr/local/bin
		$ ln -s /usr/localacl5/cl .

 You can specify an alternate destination to override the default with
 the --prefix option:

     	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/cafe

   The default value is 
		--prefix=/usr/local/cafeobj

   We shall refer this value as $prefix.

 NOTE: The configure program will cache the result of the previous
       configure execution. If you need to re-run configure from
       scratch, you may need to run "make distclean" first to remove
       the cached configuration information.

2) Try to build it:

	$ make

 This will make the needed CafeOBJ binaries within the
 subdirectories. If something fails for your system, and you want to
 submit a bug report, you may wish to include your "config.status"
 file, your host type, operating system and informations about GCL
 (version number), make output, and anything else you think will be
 helpful. 

 If want a interpreter with PigNose (a resolution based proof engine), do
        $ make bigpink

 If you made standard cafeobj previously, and changed your mind to make 
 an interpreter with PigNose, prease do
        $ make clearn
  first, and then do `make bigpink'. 

3) Install the binaries, examples, preludes...

	$ make install

   This will install CafeOBJ interpreter (cafeobj).
   And for installing cafeobj with PigNose, you need to do

        $ make install-bigpink

   Depending on your installation's configuration, you may need to be
   root to do this. 

   Some sub-directory under $prefix will be made iff do not exist, and
   necessary files are put under them:

       $prefix/bin     -- executables. cafeobj and cafeobj.XX
		          cafeobj is a shell script which invokes
                          cafeobj.exe.
       $prefix/exs     -- example module files.
       $prefix/lib     -- standard libraries, if you made cafeobj with
                          PigNose, fopl.mod will be put here.
       $prefix/prelude -- cafeobj standard prelude files.
       /usr/local/bin/cafeobj -- symbolic link to $prefix/bin/cafeobj
                                 If you need to change the place, please
                                 edit Makefile.
       $prefix/prelude/site-init.mod

4) Clean up:

	$ make clean
   
   This removes the program binaries and object files from the object code
   from $src-dir.
