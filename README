			 CafeOBJ Interpreter
			    Version 1.4

The files in this dierectory and its subdirectories constitute the
complete source code for CafeOBJ interpreter. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT:

1. Common Lisp System

Sice CafeOBJ interpter is built on Common Lisp, you need some 
Common Lisp platform. Now CafeOBJ can be built on the following
Lisp systems:
	(a) GCL version 2.2 or later
	(b) CMU-CL version 1.8f or later
	(c) ACL (Allegro Common Lisp) version 5.0 or later
	(d) CLISP

All of these Lisp systems are freely available (except ACL, for which
only Linux version is freely distributed).

GCL is now included in standard GNU package, but it can separately be
obtained from the following frp site:
	ftp://ftp.ma.utexas.edu:pub/pub/gcl
	ftp://ftp.cli.com/pub/gcl

*NOTE for GCL*
==============
	It seems that on recent Linux systems (kernel version 2.2X)
	gcl cannot be compiled. I recomend you to use CLISP intead.

For CMU-CL, you can get it from
	ftp://ftp2.cons.org/pub/lisp/cmucl/

For ACL, please consult to
	http://www.franz.com/
(We only test with freely available ACL 5.0 beta for Linux.)

And for CLISP, you can obtaint it from
	ftp://ftp.cons.org/pub/lisp/clisp
they provides binary packages for most of the platforms, please
check them and get a apropreate binary package as far as possible.

2. Resources

To install the system, it requries 14Mbytes(if you use GCL as
the platform of CafeOBJ) or much more of file spaces, which of
course varies among platforms depending to the size of compiled
files. For example, if you use CMU-CL, the executable interpreter
 would be more than 22Mbytes (on PC Linux). 

And it is strongly recommended to have more than 48Mbytes of real
memory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

UNCOMPRESS and UNTAR the SOURCES:

Change to a directory in which you wish to put CafeOBJ sources, 
which we shall call $src-dir.

*NOTE* please do not set the $src-dir "/usr/local" to, where the 
       the default installation process will put the run-time 
       resouces, thus some confusion will occur.

Copy the file cafeobj-1.xxx.tar.gz to the $src-dir.

	$ gzip -dc cafeobj.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a directory ${src-dir}/cafeobj-1.xxx with all the
resources in it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

Change to the directory in which the cafeobj resouces are put ($src-dir,
see UNCOMPRESS and UNTAR the SOURCES above.)

Please read the INSTALL contained in the distribution for full installation
instructions. 
Here's a brief summary:

	$ cd cafeobj-1.xxx
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install
